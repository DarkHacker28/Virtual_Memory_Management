# Virtual Memory Management

This repository contains a Python implementation of virtual memory management techniques, aimed at simulating the core concepts used in modern operating systems. The project includes concepts such as paging, page tables, memory allocation, and page replacement algorithms. The purpose of this project is to provide an educational tool for understanding how virtual memory works at a low level.

## Features

- **Page Table Simulation**: A simulation of a page table that maps virtual memory addresses to physical addresses.
- **Paging Algorithm Implementation**: Implements page replacement algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, and Optimal.
- **Memory Allocation**: Simulates memory allocation and deallocation, including handling page faults.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system through a simple command-line interface (CLI).
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs all memory operations, such as page accesses, page faults, and memory allocations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package manager)

To install the necessary dependencies, simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the program, you can use the following command:

python virtual_memory_management.py
Command-Line Arguments
--memory-size <size>: Specify the size of the physical memory (in KB).
--page-size <size>: Specify the size of each memory page (in KB).
--algorithm <algorithm>: Choose the page replacement algorithm. Options include FIFO, LRU, and Optimal.
--trace-file <file>: Load a memory access trace file for simulation.
Example:


python virtual_memory_management.py --memory-size 1024 --page-size 64 --algorithm FIFO --trace-file trace.txt


Algorithms Implemented


1. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
This algorithm replaces the oldest page in memory when a page fault occurs. It's a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm but is not optimal in terms of performance.

2. LRU (Least Recently Used)
The LRU algorithm replaces the least recently used page when a page fault occurs. This simulates the idea that if a page has not been used for a long time, it's less likely to be used in the future.

3. Optimal Page Replacement
This algorithm replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future. This is the optimal algorithm in terms of minimizing page faults, but it requires knowledge of future memory accesses.



Example
Let's say we have the following memory access trace:

Copy code
0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4
And a physical memory size of 4 pages with a page size of 1.



FIFO Algorithm
Page Faults: 6
Pages in Memory: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Page Replacements: [0->1, 1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->0, 0->1]


LRU Algorithm
Page Faults: 6
Pages in Memory: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Page Replacements: [0->1, 1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->0, 0->1]


Optimal Algorithm
Page Faults: 6
Pages in Memory: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Page Replacements: [0->1, 1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->0, 0->1]
